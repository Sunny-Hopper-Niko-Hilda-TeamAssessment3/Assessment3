ABOUT

Super Effects is a texture sheet animation particle pack for Unity and Unity Pro. Many of the particle effects were created from pre-rendered 3D assets. There are several levels-of-detail for each particle effect to help suit your project's needs. The particles are meant to work with both mobile and desktop projects, and utilize standard Unity shaders and material settings.

-----------------------------------------------
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PARTICLE PREFABS

I highly recommend using JMO Assets - Cartoon FX Easy Editor from the Unity Asset Store. This tool will help you make adjustments to your particle prefabs. It's easy to use and works very well. Also, it includes many functions not available in the standard or pro versions of Unity. 

Features include: scaling, looping, duration, delay, colors, and copying various Shuriken modules

Otherwise, feel free to make adjustments on your own, or with a skilled professional.
-----------------------------------------------
PARTICLE COLLISION

Prefabs containing the word "Collision" contain particles that collide with the World mesh colliders.

To adjust collision for particles in your scene:
- Load a Super Effects prefab into the Hierarchy
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Super Effect Prefab
- In the Inspector tab, notice there is a tab labeled Collision. Click on this tab to expand
- Notice the World/Planes area
- The World setting will make the particles collide with all mesh colliders in your scene
- The Planes setting allows you to assign specific planes with mesh colliders as collision meshes. To assign Planes: choose the option in the World/Planes area, then click on the small grey round icon, choose a plane for collision from the list of choices

+Note: If you have more than one collision plane, click the black + icon in the collision tab to add more collision planes
-----------------------------------------------
ADJUST COLOR & TRANSPARENCY SETTINGS

You may need to adjust color and transparency settings to best match your scene.

- Load a Super Effects Prefab into your scene
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Super Effect
- In the Inspector tab, find the Color over Lifetime and click the rectangular window to spawn the Gradient Editor window
- In the Gradient Editor window, click the small nodes on the top and bottom of the rectangle
- The top nodes control alpha transparency, the bottom nodes control color
-----------------------------------------------
MIX & MATCH

Super Effects are designed to work together.

Try adding a few different types of prefabs to the scene, and play with delay settings to make Super Duper Effects.
-----------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING - Sorting and Z-fighting

- If you notice particles flickering or rendering in front of, or behind other assets with alpha transparency, then you may need to adjust the sorting options until the problem is fixed. 
- Load a Super Effects prefab into the Hierarchy
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Super Effect Prefab
- In the Inspector tab, notice there is a tab labeled Render. Click on this tab to expand
- Make adjustments to the "Sort Mode" and "Sorting Fudge" settings.
